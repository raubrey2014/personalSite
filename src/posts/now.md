I am

enjoying my big-windowed apartment overlooking P Street, D.C.

unbelievably preparing for the tenth Pancake Friday in a row.

getting to get used to be being so close to my coffee maker.

I just finished [_Tightrope_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/588999/tightrope-by-nicholas-d-kristof-and-sheryl-wudunn/), by Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. I can't help but see similarities between my hometown of Radford, Virginia and Kristof's hometown of Yamhill, Oregon.

_Tightrope_ brought into focus just how fortunate I was to grow up with the life my parents' provided. And how fortunate I was to be tapped, just as my sister had been, to work on "advanced" material in grade school. While this "advanced" material amounted to an hour sitting at a tiny table in Ms. Thompson's side office, it was the most engaging hour of any school day. If [_Educated_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071RQXBH2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) and [_Glass Castle_](https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Castle-Memoir-Jeannette-Walls-ebook/dp/B000OVLKMM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) weren't convincing enough, it's worth reiterating - **education empowers**.

I have recently fallen in love with [Notion](https://notion.so). I found myself late at night looking for something to track, write down, or check off just because it is such a joy to use.

Facing an end of sorts to ALMA's startup adventure, I am looking to new opportunities.
