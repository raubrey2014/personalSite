Currently enjoying my big-windowed room overlooking P Street, D.C. with too many trips to the coffee maker, unbelievably preparing for something like the eighth Pancake Friday in a row.

I just finished [_Tightrope_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/588999/tightrope-by-nicholas-d-kristof-and-sheryl-wudunn/), by Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. I can't help but see similarities in my hometown memories of Radford, VA - suddenly seeing how fortunately I was to have been tapped, just as my sister had, to work on "advanced" material in grade school. While this amounted to a tiny table in Ms. Thompson's side office, it was the most engaging hour of any school day.

I have recently fallen in love with [Notion](https://notion.so). I found myself late at night looking for something to track, write down, or check off just because it is such a joy to use.

Facing an end of sorts to ALMA's startup adventure, I am looking to new opportunities.
