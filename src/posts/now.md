I am

enjoying my big-windowed apartment overlooking P Street, D.C.

unbelievably preparing for the 10+ Pancake Friday in a row.

trying to get used to be being so close to my coffee maker.

I finished [_This Land is Our Land_: An immigrant's manifesto](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374276027) by Suketu Mehta, in the Logan Circle grass - with other well separated quarantine-pods. The world is different, but some things never change: a passionate author can captivate you. Few books have opened my eyes in the way this one has.

Reading this book felt like living on [_Elysium_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium_(film)). A faraway place, where those born on one side of a border will dare feats of fantasy and fiction to reach the other side, another place, a better place.

His sections say it all
- Part I: The Migrants Are Coming
- Part II: Why They're Coming
- Part III: Why They're Feared
- Part IV: Why They Should Be Welcomed

Mehta's book emphasizes the privilege of living in the United States, the privilege of opportunity, the privilege of work, the privilege of safety. I have taken these privileges for granted, but hundreds of millions of immigrants have not.

Despite its 'rage and sadness', Mehta's message is one of hope - hope for a world that sees immigrants for their tenacity, entrepreneurship, and ultimately, their humanity.

I just finished [_Tightrope_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/588999/tightrope-by-nicholas-d-kristof-and-sheryl-wudunn/), by Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. I can't help but see similarities between my hometown of Radford, Virginia and Kristof's hometown of Yamhill, Oregon.

_Tightrope_ brought into focus just how fortunate I was to grow up with the life my parents' provided. And how fortunate I was to be tapped, just as my sister had been, to work on "advanced" material in grade school. While this "advanced" material amounted to an hour sitting at a tiny table in Ms. Thompson's side office, it was the most engaging hour of any school day. If [_Educated_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071RQXBH2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) and [_Glass Castle_](https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Castle-Memoir-Jeannette-Walls-ebook/dp/B000OVLKMM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) weren't convincing enough, it's worth reiterating - **education empowers**.

I have recently fallen in love with [Notion](https://notion.so). I found myself late at night looking for something to track, write down, or check off just because it is such a joy to use.

Facing an end of sorts to ALMA's startup adventure, I am looking to new opportunities.
