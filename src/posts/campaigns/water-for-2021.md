### Thank you

It was truly special to see so much generosity for this year's Water for 2021 Campaign. Thank you to each and every one of you.

Through your generosity, the W2021 Campaign raised **\$2,795**, providing 69 of the world's neediest people with clean drinking water.

This easily surpassed our \$2,000 goal!

### Why charity: water?

With an unmatched focus on showing exactly where your money goes and why, charity: water has set the standard for transparency in philanthropy.

### Next year - \$10,000

With this mission in mind, our next goal is clear.

\$10,000. This is the amount needed to [_sponsor an entire project_](https://www.charitywater.org/donate/water-project-sponsorship#). Many water projects can cost more, but this amount is the minimum for [official project sponsors](https://www.charitywater.org/donate/water-project-sponsorship#).

The pinnacle of charity: water's impact focus, sponsoring a project allows us behind stage to see project level reporting throughout the lifetime of the project.

Sponsoring a water project is the goal, let's see if we can do it. Our success would mean measurable positive change for one of our world's neediest communities.

In the coming months, I will be in touch about our fundraising efforts, focused again towards the end of the year. Sit back and relax; if you are interested in giving more significantly, getting involved in the fundraising process, or have any questions at all, please do not hesitate in reaching out.
