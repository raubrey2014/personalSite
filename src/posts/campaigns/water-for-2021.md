### Thank you

It was truly special to see so much generosity for this year's Water for 2021 Campaign. Thank you to each and every one of you.

Through your generosity, the W2021 Campaign raised **\$2,795**, providing 69 of the world's neediest people with clean drinking water. We easily surpassed our \$2,000 goal!

Each one of you has made a real difference. Thank you.

charity: water will group our donation with other campaigns to fund an entire project. [This is an example](https://www.charitywater.org/projects/166-62?campaign_id=52478) of what we can expect to see in the months ahead. It's a long ways off, but I look forward to sharing the results of our efforts with each of you.

<br />
<br />

### Next year - \$10,000

\$10,000. This is the amount needed to [_sponsor an entire project_](https://www.charitywater.org/donate/water-project-sponsorship#). Many water projects can cost more, but this amount is the minimum for [official project sponsors](https://www.charitywater.org/donate/water-project-sponsorship#).

Sponsoring a project allows us behind stage to see project level reporting throughout the lifetime of the project. Our success would mean measurable positive change for one of our world's neediest communities, as well as a unique opportunity to feel a part of their ambitious mission: ending global water poverty.

In the coming months, I will be in touch about our fundraising efforts, focused again towards the end of the year. Sit back and relax; if you are interested in giving more significantly, getting involved in the fundraising process, or have any questions at all, please do not hesitate in reaching out.

### Why charity: water?

If you have the time, I wanted to share why this matters to me.

For Christmas 2019, my older sister, Erin, gifted me a book with a simple title: _Thirst_. Therein, the author, a man named Scott Harrison, described his life's journey. From humble beginnings caring for his sick mother outside of Philadelphia, Scott's life changed drastically when he moved to New York City at 18. Scott spent 10 years climbing the social ladder as a night club promoter, along the way picking up a "serious drinking problem, a cocaine problem, a gambling problem...".

Scott felt he had become "emotionally bankrupt" and was "rotting inside". In an effort to find some sort of moral foundation, Scott sold everything he had, smoked his last packs of Marlboro Reds, and shipped off to help with a humanitarian aid project in war-torn Liberia. He served as a photographer for an organization called Mercy Ships that brings surgeons and doctors to places without hope of medical care.

Scott never lost his email list from his years of promoting (early 2000s, people actually reading their emails), and he began sharing his dramatic photography: the miracle work performed by the organization, and the gut wrenching suffering endured in Liberia. Scott was met with an overwhelming response: people were desperate to contribute and help those suffering. Scott would never forget the power of communicating impact through photography, writing, and story-telling.

Scott returned to New York City on a mission. From his time in Liberia, he saw just how much the people there suffered due to lack of basic necessities, namely clean drinking water. Out of his tiny Manhatten apartment, Scott launched what would ultimately become **charity: water**.

<br />
<br />

I poured through the book, enveloped in Scott's passion and ultimately in the story of his moral redemption. After years of living his life for himself, Scott was reborn into a life focused on others.

Out of these humble beginnings, charity: water has set the standard in philanthropy for communicating impact. As a result, they have raised almost half a billion dollars towards providing clean water for the world's neediest communities.

It has been Scott's focus on impact, charity: water's scrappy start-up roots, and the power of redemption found in the pages of _Thirst_ that has made me feel a part of this most ambitious goal: ending global water poverty.

My hope is to bring a few of you along with me.
