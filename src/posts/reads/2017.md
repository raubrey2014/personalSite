2017 is when I first started reading in earnest, for the first time finding real engagement and interest in non-fiction. I have never poured myself more into reading than this year.

This are listed reverse chronologically, so it all started with _The Book Thief_. It thus has a special place in my heart, though ironically it is a fictional story.

My non-fiction binge all started with _The Rational Optimist_. Reading this made it clear - there was no more intricate or interesting story than our own.
