title: "reads | 2018"
---

After an important [2017](/reads/2017) of reading in my life, I wanted more. I set out in 2018 to read one more book than last year.

This ended up being a mistake - I put pressure on myself to read for the wrong reasons. Each book became a box to be checked rather than a way to challenge your thinking, peer into another world.

While I ended up reading less, I now value each moment I dedicate to reading more. With so many good books, I finally agreed to my mom's simple advice: **if you don't like it, it's not worth reading**.

And somehow reviewing my list there are some real gems. The highlights here, I believe, are not coincidentally linked.
